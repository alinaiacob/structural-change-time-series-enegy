The scope of this project is to analyze the historical evolution and market behavior of some of the most important energy related companies (renawable energy, nuclear energy, energy infrastructure). 
This analysis focuses on performance trends, volatility patterns and also correlation with broader market movements.

Companies used for this project are the following:
#Next Power Energy - NXT
#NextEra Energy - NEE
#Centrus Energy - LEU
#Energy Fuels - UUUU
#Enphase Energy - ENPH

Additionally, for this study I used the S&P500 index to enable a comparative analysis between the energy sector and the broader U.S. market.

With the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure, increasing electrification, and the growing need for scalable and reliable energy sources, energy-related companies are becoming strategically critical.
This study aims to highlight market interest, risk characteristics, and relative performance of energy companies in comparison to the overall market.
